This git repo contains a short ansible playbook to manage my
personal vim settings and various home directory dotfiles.

Install Ansible in a virtualenv on a fresh system:

sudo apt-get install python-virtualenv python-dev

mkdir ~/ansible
cd ~/ansible

virtualenv pyenv
. pyenv/bin/activate
pip install ansible

Once Ansible is installed and the virtualenv environment is
activated from the base of the dotfiles directory run the 
dependencies playbook:

ansible-playbook -i inventory dependencies.yml -K

The dotfiles playbook (run as blocke):

ansible-playbook -i inventory dotfiles.yml
